[33m8a32ca0[m added some metrics
[33m15fe10d[m added random weight initialization after pruning
[33m25b8bc8[m finished l1 mag distributions
[33mbf2f5a0[m Started making the l1 magnitude distributions per layer
[33md0765e0[m Cleaned up some code
[33m1860a9e[m tried parent child structure in wandb, not sure if it works
[33m67bfce7[m Trying to put all stages as childs of one parent run instead of each one as individual run, not yet succeeded
[33md258a37[m linked the project to wandb for experiment tracking
[33m358a8c8[m finished pipeline files for baseline training + eval and one for pruning + eval + retraining + eval
[33m671dcd2[m Pipeline now puts everything in the correct folder, next up; make the yaml file more compact and make py files to run multiple parts of the pipeline like; prune_retrain_eval
[33m5e6a4d2[m started on steering everything from a config.yaml file, not yet correct
[33m578248a[m added chaging learning rate if dice plateaus
[33m444ec2a[m Pipline is also working for larger UNet
[33mab1d856[m Finished first working version of pruning pipeline, including retraining and evaluation. Next thing will be config files to steer everything and logical folders for saving results
[33me4f6e1f[m Reorganized the pruning folder, trying to make nice pipeline next
[33mc27dc8a[m non uniformal pruning is working and can be evaluated, metric not yet correct
[33m2536779[m got the evaluation on a pruned model working
[33mf4527af[m quick save before trying to make the evaluation function more dynamic
[33m1b29749[m Think i got the non uniform pruning ratios working as well, problem lied at the shape of the skip connection
[33mdb3fa95[m working pruning code for uniformal pruning ratio
[33m8ec76eb[m added pruning code, not yet correctly devided into modules and evaluation not yet working becuase model not saved correctly
[33me35ddc0[m added quick gpt generated readme
[33m73ff014[m added quick gpt generated readme
[33m4044b18[m Removed the config files
