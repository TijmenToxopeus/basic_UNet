# Dataset

This framework uses **2D slices extracted from 3D NIfTI volumes (`.nii.gz`)**, such as those provided by the **ACDC cardiac MRI dataset** (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge).  
Each patient folder contains two cardiac phases:

- **End-diastolic (ED)**
- **End-systolic (ES)**

together with corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks.

The ACDC dataset consists of short-axis cardiac MRI scans acquired across multiple centers, scanners, and patient conditions.  
For each patient, the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and myocardium are manually annotated.

**End-diastolic (ED)** represents the moment when the heart is **maximally filled with blood** (largest ventricular volume), just before contraction.  
**End-systolic (ES)** is the moment after the heart has **fully contracted** (smallest ventricular volume).  

These two phases capture the extreme points of the cardiac cycle and are commonly used for evaluating cardiac function, including stroke volume and ejection fraction.  
Because both ED and ES volumes include clear anatomical variation and clinically relevant shape differences, they provide a rich set of examples for training and evaluating the segmentation model.

## Meaning of Each File

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `patient001_4d.nii.gz` | Complete 4D cine stack (not always used directly) |
| `patient001_frame01.nii.gz` | End-diastolic (ED) volume |
| `patient001_frame01_gt.nii.gz` | ED ground-truth mask |
| `patient001_frame12.nii.gz` | End-systolic (ES) volume |
| `patient001_frame12_gt.nii.gz` | ES ground-truth mask |

The masks contain **integer class labels** (not RGB colors):
- 0 → background  
- 1 → RV  
- 2 → myocardium  
- 3 → LV  

---

## 📏 Dataset Size

The ACDC dataset used in this project contains:

- **100 patients** in the training set  
- **50 patients** in the test set  
- Each patient provides **2 three-dimensional MRI volumes** (ED and ES)  
- Each 3D volume contains approximately **10 short-axis slices**

This results in approximately:

**Training set:**
100 patients × 2 volumes × 10 slices ≈ **2000 slices**

**Test set:**
50 patients × 2 volumes × 10 slices ≈ **1000 slices**

These 3D volumes are later converted into 2D slices for training the 2D UNet.

## Preprocessing

Because the UNet model is **2D**, while MRI volumes are **3D**, the preprocessing pipeline converts full 3D NIfTI volumes into clean, normalized, augmentable **2D slices** that can be fed into the network.  
The preprocessing steps are as follows:

---

1. **Raw Data Organization**  
   The raw MRI scans and their corresponding labels are stored as full 3D NIfTI volumes (`.nii.gz`) in separate folders for images and labels.

2. **3D → 2D Slice Extraction**  
   Each 3D volume typically has shape `(H, W, Slices)`.  
   Because the model is 2D, individual 2D slices are extracted along a specified axis:
   ```python
   img2d = np.take(img3d, slice_index, axis=slice_axis)
   lbl2d = np.take(lbl3d, slice_index, axis=slice_axis)

3. **Normalization & Resizing**  
Every extracted 2D slice is resized to a fixed `256 × 256` resolution and normalized to produce consistent MRI contrast across patients.

4. **Data Augmentation (Training Only)**  
   During training, augmentations such as `RandomElasticDeformation`, `RandomNoise`, and `RandomGamma` are applied to:
   - increase dataset diversity  
   - improve robustness  
   - enhance generalization to unseen MRI scans  

5. **Train/Validation Split and Batching**  
After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and validation subsets, which are loaded in batches and fed to the training loop.

# Configuration System

All experiment settings are defined in a single central file:

    config.yaml

This file contains **all model parameters, training hyperparameters, data settings, and pruning options**, allowing the entire system to be controlled from one unified location.

Example:

    model:
      in_channels: 1
      out_channels: 4

    training:
      batch_size: 8
      learning_rate: 1e-3
      num_epochs: 40

    pruning:
      block_ratios:
        encoders.1: 0.1
        decoders.3: 0.3
      reinitialize_weights: rewind

Pipelines can override fields such as learning rate, number of epochs, pruning ratios, or the rewinding mode during automated sweeps. This makes experiments fully reproducible while keeping configuration management clean and centralized.

---

# Repository Pipelines Overview

This repository consists of **two main pipelines**:

---

# 1️⃣ Baseline Training + Evaluation

Run the full UNet training and a final evaluation:

    python -m src.pipeline.baseline

This pipeline:
- trains the UNet from scratch  
- saves model checkpoints  
- evaluates the final model on the validation set  
- outputs:
  - `metrics.json`
  - training curves (`training_curves.png`)
  - prediction samples

---

# 2️⃣ Pruning + Evaluation + Retraining + Evaluation

Run the structured pruning workflow:

    python -m src.pipeline.pruned --mode <none|random|rewind>

This pipeline performs the full pruning cycle:

---

## **Step 1 — Structured L1 Block-wise Pruning**
- compute L1 norms for each filter  
- rank and prune the lowest-norm filters according to `block_ratios`  
- generate pruning masks  
- apply the masks to remove channels from the UNet  

Example block ratios:
block_ratios:  
  encoders.0: 0.0
  encoders.1: 0.1
  decoders.3: 0.4
  decoders.5: 0.2

---

## **Step 2 — Rebuild the Pruned UNet**
After pruning, the architecture is rebuilt:
- reads pruning masks  
- computes the new (reduced) channel widths  
- constructs a smaller UNet  
- loads the surviving weights correctly  

---

## **Step 3 — Apply Weight Initialization Mode**
The rebuilt model is initialized using the specified rewinding option:

- `none` → keep surviving weights  
- `random` → reinitialize pruned model  
- `rewind` → restore weights from an earlier checkpoint  

---

## **Step 4 — Evaluate the Pruned Model**
Evaluate the pruned model before retraining:

    python -m src.training.eval

---

## **Step 5 — Retrain the Pruned Model**
(Optional depending on pipeline configuration)

Retrains the reduced model to recover performance.

---

## **Step 6 — Final Evaluation**
Evaluate again after retraining to measure pruning impact.

    results/analysis/

# Experiment Logging

    logging:
      use_wandb: true
      project: "basic_unet_pruning"

# Full Experiment Runner

Run the entire pipeline:

    python -m src.pipeline.run_full_exp

This script executes **both previously described pipelines** (baseline training/evaluation and the full pruning workflow) in a single automated sequence.

It performs:

    1. Train baseline
    2. Prune (mode=none)
    3. Prune (mode=random)
    4. Prune (mode=rewind)
    5. Evaluate all

The runner can include **multiple nested loops** to systematically test different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, epochs) and/or compare the effect of various **block ratio configurations**.  
Each experiment automatically overrides the LR, epoch count, pruning ratios, and rewinding mode.
