# 🧩 basic_UNet

This project implements a lightweight **U-Net** architecture for 2D medical image segmentation (tested on the ACDC dataset).  
It includes training, evaluation, and structured pruning tools, along with model inspection utilities.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Modular **U-Net** implementation (easy to extend)
- **Training & validation** pipeline with Dice/IoU metrics
- **Model inspection** for layer shapes and L1-norm statistics
- **Structured pruning** (L1-based) for model compression
- Automatic logging of metrics and checkpoints

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🧠 Train a baseline model
```bash
python -m src.training.train
```

### 🔍 Evaluate a trained model
```bash
python -m src.training.evaluate
```

### ✂️ Inspect or prune a model
```bash
python -m src.pruning.model_inspect
```

## 📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TijmenToxopeus/basic_UNet.git
cd basic_UNet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📊 Outputs
- Checkpoints and logs are saved under:
  ```
  results/UNet_ACDC/<date>/baseline/training/
  ```
- Metrics are stored in `metrics.json` and visualized as `training_curves.png`.
